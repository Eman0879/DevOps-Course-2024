# Overview 

This semester, as part of my DevOps course, I explored various modern technologies and deployment methods. This repository summarizes the tools and technologies I learned, the blogs I published, and the key takeaways from my experience.

# Blogs
### 1. [From Parsing to Perfection: The Evolution of CV Parsing and the Future of Automatic CV Refactoring](https://medium.com/@emanh9746/from-parsing-to-perfection-the-evolution-of-cv-parsing-and-the-future-of-automatic-cv-refactoring-33d40abdadd0)
In this blog, I have talked about CV parsing, a process that extracts key information like name, email, and skills from resumes and converts it into structured formats for efficient analysis. While CV parsing improves recruitment efficiency, it struggles with understanding context, handling unique job requirements, and avoiding bias. The blog introduces automatic CV refactoring powered by GenAI as a solution to these limitations. It tailors CVs to specific job postings, enhances ATS compatibility, and streamlines applications, particularly benefiting fresh graduates. Key considerations like data privacy, authenticity, and ethical AI use are also discussed, highlighting the potential of advanced tools in modern recruitment.

### 2. [Getting Started with Kubeflow Pipelines: Build and Deploy kubeflow pipeline locally](https://medium.com/@emanh9746/getting-started-with-kubeflow-pipelines-build-and-deploy-kubeflow-pipeline-locally-0a1ecc548c21)
In this blog, I have provided a comprehensive overview of Kubeflow Pipelines, a framework for building, deploying, and managing machine learning workflows on Kubernetes. It details the key components of Kubeflow architecture, benefits of using pipelines, and their scalability and collaboration features. The blog also offers a step-by-step guide to deploying Kubeflow Pipelines locally, including setting up Docker, Minikube, and the pipeline environment. A practical example of an Iris Classifier pipeline demonstrates creating reusable components, compiling workflows into YAML, and executing them via the Kubeflow UI. This guide simplifies understanding and deploying Kubeflow Pipelines for ML tasks.

## Tools and Technologies Learned 

  1. ### Docker
   
  Software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly.It packages software into standardized units called 
  containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can 
  quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

  2. ### Kubernetes
   
  Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It 
  organizes applications into logical units called pods for easy management and discovery. By leveraging features like load balancing, 
  self-healing, and automated rollouts, Kubernetes ensures high availability and scalability of applications in a distributed environment.

  3. ### Ingress
   
  Ingress in Kubernetes is like a traffic controller for your applications. It helps direct incoming internet traffic to the right 
  services inside your Kubernetes cluster. It can also manage things like secure connections (HTTPS) and balance traffic to ensure your 
  services run smoothly. Ingress makes it easier to expose your apps to the outside world without needing to expose every individual 
  service directly.

  4. ### Kvyerno
   
  Kyverno is a policy management tool for Kubernetes that helps you enforce security and operational best practices within your cluster. 
  It allows you to define, validate, and manage policies for Kubernetes resources like pods, deployments, and namespaces. You can ensure 
  compliance by automatically applying rules, such as restricting certain image sources to the resources in your cluster.

  5. ### Knative
    
  Knative is an open-source platform built on Kubernetes that simplifies the development and deployment of serverless applications. It 
  enables developers to build, deploy, and scale applications automatically based on demand, without managing the underlying 
  infrastructure.
  It supports both event-driven and HTTP-based workloads, making it ideal for building scalable, cloud-native applications.

  6. ### AWS
    
  cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that offers a wide range of services, such as computing power, storage, databases, machine 
  learning, and networking, all delivered over the internet. AWS allows businesses and developers to run applications and store data 
  without needing to manage physical servers

  7. ### Istio
    
  Istio is an open-source service mesh that helps manage microservices in a cloud-native environment. It provides a set of tools to 
  control how microservices communicate with each other, including traffic management, security, monitoring, and observability.

  8. ### Prometheus
    
  Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects and stores time- 
  series data (metrics) about applications, services, and infrastructure, allowing users to track performance and health. Prometheus 
  scrapes data from configured endpoints, stores it in a time-series database, and allows querying with a powerful query language called 
  PromQL.

  9. ### Grafana
    
  Grafana is an open-source data visualization and monitoring platform used to display real-time data from various sources, including 
  Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and others. It allows users to create interactive and customizable dashboards to visualize metrics, logs, 
  and application data. Grafana supports various visualization types, including graphs, tables, heatmaps, and more
